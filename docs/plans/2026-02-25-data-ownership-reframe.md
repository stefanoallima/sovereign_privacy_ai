# Messaging Reframe: Data Ownership

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Scope:** website/index.html, README.md

## Problem

Current framing leads with the AI Council / Karpathy angle. Privacy is a feature. Target audience (professionals with sensitive data) needs to feel the risk first, then see the solution.

## New Frame

**Core claim:** Your data is yours. Not theirs.
**Tone:** User-empowerment. Not paranoid. Factual.
**Audience:** Professionals (lawyers, accountants, consultants, freelancers) who already use AI for work.

## Structure (Option A — Three Threats, One Answer)

### Hero
- **Headline:** Your data is yours. Not theirs.
- **Subhead (approved C):** Most professionals wouldn't hand their tax returns to a stranger. Yet every question you ask a cloud AI — about your finances, your health, your clients — leaves your machine permanently. What happens to it after that is their decision, not yours.

### Three Threats Section: "What actually happens to your data"

**Threat 1 — Your data trains their models**
Inline proof: NYT v. OpenAI (Dec 2023), Carlini et al. training data extraction paper (Google DeepMind, 2023), Harry Potter verbatim recitation.

**Threat 2 — Your prompts are product research**
Inline proof: OpenAI Terms of Use (right to use interactions), Atlantic "OpenAI Is Eating the Startup Ecosystem" (2024).

**Threat 3 — Free AI has a business model. You're in it.**
Inline proof: Forbes "OpenAI Considers Advertising" (2024), WSJ "Microsoft Adds Ads to Copilot" (2024).

**Closing observation (replaces GDPR threat — avoids Nebius tension):**
"Most professionals already use cloud AI for sensitive work — not because they've assessed the risk, but because it's there and it's fast. Sovereign doesn't ask you to stop using AI. It gives you a version you can use without wondering whether you should."

GDPR/Garante citations folded quietly under Threat 1 as additional context.

### Bridge
"Sovereign AI was built on one principle: what you type stays on your machine. No training. No ads. No one else's roadmap funded by your questions."

### Product features follow (existing, kept as-is structurally)

## Proof Point Format
Icon + bold claim + linked citation in small text. Inline, not in a separate section.
