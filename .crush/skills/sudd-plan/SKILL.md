---

Create detailed specifications, design, and implementation tasks for a change.

**Input**:
- `/sudd-plan` — use active change
- `/sudd-plan {change-id}` — specific change

---

## ORCHESTRATOR CHECK

```bash
cat sudd/state.json
```

If no active change:
1. Check `sudd/changes/active/` for available changes
2. If none: "No changes found. Run `/sudd-new` first."
3. If one: auto-select
4. If multiple: list and ask

If active change has no proposal:
- Run `/sudd-new` first (or auto-create if autonomous)

---

## STEP 1: READ CONTEXT

Read:
- `sudd/vision.md`
- `sudd/changes/active/{id}/proposal.md`
- `sudd/personas/*.md` (if exist)
- `sudd/specs/` for related specs
- Codebase for patterns

---

## STEP 2: RESEARCH (IF NEEDED)

Run research agents if artifacts are missing (not based on mode):
- If `sudd/personas/*.md` contains ONLY `default.md` (no real consumer personas discovered)
- OR if `specs.md` has no `### Handoff:` section (no consumer contracts defined)

This makes research artifact-based, not mode-based. Brown-mode projects that
lack consumer research get the same discovery pass as green-mode projects.

If either condition is true, run research agents:

```
Task(agent=researcher):
  - Investigate technologies needed
  - Find patterns in codebase
  - Identify standards to follow

Task(agent=persona-detector):
  - Discover WHO consumes this output
  - Map consumer chain

Task(agent=persona-researcher):
  - Deep-research each consumer
  - Find deal-breakers, formats, unknown unknowns
```

Aggregate findings.

### Change-Level Persona Research (v3.0)

In addition to repo-level persona research, create change-level personas:

```
Task(agent=persona-detector, scope=change):
  - Who consumes THIS CHANGE's combined output?
  - Write to: sudd/changes/active/{id}/personas/

Task(agent=persona-researcher, scope=change):
  - Deep-research each change consumer
  - Write to: sudd/changes/active/{id}/personas/{consumer-name}.md
```

---

## STEP 3: CREATE SPECS

Write `sudd/changes/active/{id}/specs.md`:

```markdown
# Specifications: {change-id}

## Functional Requirements
### FR-1: {requirement}
- Given: 
- When: 
- Then: 

## Non-Functional Requirements
### NFR-1: {requirement}
- Constraint: 
- Rationale: 

## API Contracts
### Endpoint/Interface: {name}
- Input: {schema}
- Output: {schema}
- Errors: {cases}

## Data Models
### {Model}
- field: type (constraints)

## Consumer Handoffs
### Handoff 1: {Producer} → {Consumer}
- Format: 
- Schema: 
- Validation: 

## Handoff Contracts (v3.8.18 — AC #15)

Declare the interface contract between agents so `contract-verifier` can
enforce each transition. Every active change MUST fill in all four rows.

| From                    | To                    | Contract                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| coder                   | qa                    | Produced files listed under each task's `Files:` exist, compile, and expose the signatures specs declare. |
| qa                      | persona-validator     | Tests exist for every Given/When/Then in `tasks/{id}/micro-persona.md`; all referenced fixtures present. |
| persona-validator       | gate                  | Persona score ≥ 98/100 for every persona in `active/{id}/personas/`; no deal-breakers triggered.         |
| gate                    | (done/stuck)          | Gate rubric score meets threshold (default 98) AND macro-wiring-checker reports no dangling artifacts.  |

`contract-verifier` runs at each phase transition and HALTs the build loop
if any row's contract is violated. `macro-wiring-checker` runs at gate
entry (gate.md Step 0) for change-level reachability.

## Out of Scope

```

## STEP 4: CREATE DESIGN

Write `sudd/changes/active/{id}/design.md`:

```markdown
# Design: {change-id}

## Architecture Overview
{ASCII diagram of components}

## Component: {name}
### Responsibility
### Dependencies
### Interface
### Implementation Notes

## Data Flow
{ASCII diagram}

## Sequence Diagrams
{for complex interactions}

## File Changes
### New Files
- path/to/file.py — description

### Modified Files
- path/to/file.py — changes

## Configuration
- New config needed: 
- Env vars: 

## Migration Plan
- Step 1: 
- Step 2: 
```

---

## STEP 4.5: UI SPECIFICATION (v3.1)

If the change involves UI (proposal mentions frontend, dashboard, form, page, web interface,
OR design.md includes components producing HTML/CSS/JS):

```
Task(agent=ux-architect):
  Input: proposal.md, specs.md, design.md, existing UI patterns, change personas
  Output: ## UI Specification section appended to design.md

  Covers:
  - Information architecture (content hierarchy, navigation)
  - Component specification (tree, props/state, reuse vs new)
  - Interaction design (user flows, state transitions, feedback)
  - Responsive strategy (breakpoints, layout shifts)
  - Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA, focus order, ARIA)
  - Visual direction (delegates to superpowers:frontend-design for execution)
```

If no UI involvement detected: SKIP this step.

---

## STEP 5: CREATE TASKS

Write `sudd/changes/active/{id}/tasks.md`:

```markdown
# Tasks: {change-id}

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] T1: {task description}
  - Files:
  - SharedFiles: {lock files, configs, routers that other tasks may also touch — leave empty if none}
  - Effort: S/M/L
  - Dependencies:

- [ ] T2: {task description}
  - Files:
  - SharedFiles:
  - Effort: S/M/L
  - Dependencies: T1

## Test Tasks
- [ ] T3: Write tests for X
- [ ] T4: Write tests for Y

## Documentation Tasks
- [ ] T5: Update README
- [ ] T6: Add inline docs

---
Total: N tasks | Est. effort: {sum}
```


---

## STEP 5.5: GENERATE MICRO-PERSONAS (v3.0)

After tasks.md is created, generate micro-personas for every task:

```
Task(agent=micro-persona-generator):
  Input: tasks.md, design.md, specs.md, codebase
  Output: sudd/changes/active/{id}/tasks/{task-id}/micro-persona.md (one per task)
```

Create directory structure:
```bash
for each task T{N} in tasks.md:
  mkdir -p sudd/changes/active/{id}/tasks/T{N}/
```

Verify: every task has a micro-persona.md. If any are missing, log warning.

---

## STEP 5.6: RUBRIC ADVERSARY CYCLE (v3.8.18 — AC #12, #13, #14)

A rubric that isn't critiqued before it scores live code tends to pass
anything and fail nothing. This is what made SUDD v3.1 rubrics rigorous:
adversarial pressure before the rubric ever runs.

**Max 3 rounds. Exit when the adversary finds nothing meaningful.**

For each task T{N} with a generated micro-persona.md, loop:

```
Round 1 (rubric v1):
  Save initial rubric from STEP 5.5 output:
    cp sudd/changes/active/{id}/tasks/T{N}/micro-persona.md \
       sudd/changes/active/{id}/rubric-drafts/T{N}_v1.md

  Task(agent=rubric-adversary):
    Input:  rubric-drafts/T{N}_v1.md
    Output: rubric-drafts/T{N}_critique_v1.md
    Looks for: ambiguous criteria, missing edge cases, measurable-ness
               failures, Given/When/Then that a test can't actually execute.

  If critique is "nothing meaningful" (empty findings or only nits):
    → Exit loop. Rubric v1 is final. Skip revision.
  Else:
    → Proceed to revision.

Round 2 (rubric v2 after critique):
  Task(agent=code-analyzer-reviewer, mode=rubric-revision):
    Input:  rubric-drafts/T{N}_v1.md + rubric-drafts/T{N}_critique_v1.md
    Output: rubric-drafts/T{N}_v2.md (incorporates critique findings)

  Task(agent=rubric-adversary):
    Input:  rubric-drafts/T{N}_v2.md
    Output: rubric-drafts/T{N}_critique_v2.md

  If "nothing meaningful":
    → Exit loop. Write v2 back to tasks/T{N}/micro-persona.md. Final.
  Else:
    → Proceed to round 3.

Round 3 (rubric v3 — last pass):
  Task(agent=code-analyzer-reviewer, mode=rubric-revision):
    Input:  rubric-drafts/T{N}_v2.md + rubric-drafts/T{N}_critique_v2.md
    Output: rubric-drafts/T{N}_v3.md

  Round 3 ends the cycle regardless. Write v3 back to
  tasks/T{N}/micro-persona.md. Log any remaining adversary findings
  to log.md under "## Rubric Adversary — Unresolved" as known weaknesses.
```

**Output directory** (AC #14): `sudd/changes/active/{id}/rubric-drafts/` holds the
full audit trail — every version and every critique — so humans can replay
the adversarial process. The final rubric lives at
`tasks/{task-id}/micro-persona.md` as the single source of truth consumed
by QA and the validation squad.

**Dispatch pattern summary (AC #13):**
```
micro-persona-generator (v1) → rubric-adversary (critique v1)
                              → code-analyzer-reviewer (v2)
                              → rubric-adversary (critique v2)
                              → code-analyzer-reviewer (v3)
                              [exit — max 3 rounds]
```

---

## STEP 6: UPDATE STATE

Update `sudd/state.json`:
```json
{
  "phase": "build",
  "last_command": "sudd-plan"
}
```

---

## OUTPUT

```
Planned: sudd/changes/active/{change-id}/

  proposal.md  ✓ (existing)
  specs.md     ✓ (created)
  design.md    ✓ (created)
  tasks.md     ✓ (created)
  personas/          ✓ (created — change-level personas)
  tasks/T1/micro-persona.md  ✓ (created)
  tasks/T2/micro-persona.md  ✓ (created)
  ...
  
  Tasks: N total
  Estimated effort: {sum}

  Micro-personas: N generated
  Change personas: M researched

Next: Run /sudd-apply to start implementation
```

---

## GUARDRAILS

- Always read proposal first
- Run research when artifacts are missing (personas or handoff contracts), regardless of mode
- Create handoff contracts in specs
- Tasks should be granular (1-2 hours each)
- Update state.json phase to "build"
