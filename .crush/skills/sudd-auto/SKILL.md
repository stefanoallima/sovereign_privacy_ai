Fully autonomous mode. Processes all proposed changes in sequence,
each in a fresh CLI session.

## EXECUTION — FIRE AND FORGET

**CRITICAL**: dispatch the binary with `run_in_background: true` and
IMMEDIATELY return control to the user. Do NOT tail the log, do NOT
sleep-and-cat, do NOT poll for progress, do NOT "imagine" while
waiting. The binary is self-contained — it launches its own fresh CLI
subprocess per change, enforces budgets, handles crashes, and writes
reports to `sudd/auto-reports/{date}/`. Staying active in this shell
burns tokens on passive tail-watching while the real work happens in
children you don't control. The user invokes `/sudd-status` on their
schedule — that is the only acceptable monitoring channel.

**Run via Bash with `run_in_background: true`**:

```bash
sudd auto
```

Then reply with exactly one line confirming dispatch:

> Launched `sudd auto` in the background. Run `/sudd-status` any time to check progress, or read `sudd/auto-reports/{today}/summary.md` when the session ends.

Then STOP. Do not read the log. Do not call Bash again. Do not enter a
wait loop. The next user message is your next input.

### Fallback if `sudd` is not on PATH

```bash
sudd-go/bin/sudd auto
```

### Build-then-run if the binary doesn't exist

```bash
cd sudd-go && make build && cd .. && sudd-go/bin/sudd auto
```

Same rule after either fallback: dispatch, one-line reply, stop.

### Preflight gate (v3.8.11+)

`sudd auto` runs `sudd doctor` as step 0 and refuses to start on any
blocker (missing CLI, broken auth, degraded sudd.yaml, missing MCP
tool). Results are cached per-device for 12h keyed by git SHA + yaml
hash, so subsequent sessions on the same day skip preflight. Flags:

- `--fresh`    — ignore cache, rerun all checks
- `--probe`    — additionally send a 1-token prompt through each tier
                 (catches silent plan/quota issues, ~3 tokens total)
- `--skip-preflight` — escape hatch; use only when you have a reason

### Vision.md auto-inference (v3.8.12+)

Each spawned `sudd-run` subprocess begins with a vision-check step.
If `sudd/vision.md` is empty, the subprocess synthesizes one from the
repo's README, PROJECT_REPORT, AGENTS.md, top-level markdown, and
package.json before doing any actual work. Populated vision.md is
always preserved — never overwritten by update or by this step.

## CONFIGURATION

Set in sudd.yaml under `auto:`:

    auto:
      max_hours: 8                    # session time limit
      max_changes: 5                  # max changes per session
      per_change_timeout_hours: 4     # kill runaway changes
      stop_on_stuck: false            # continue after STUCK changes
      priority_order: "oldest_first"  # oldest_first | newest_first
      vision_last: true               # vision.md runs last
      cli_override: ""                # auto-detect from tiers.mid.cli
      cli_flags: "--max-turns 200"    # flags for CLI subprocess
      max_report_days: 30             # auto-delete reports older than this

## CLI FLAGS NOTE

The default `cli_flags: "--max-turns 200"` works with `claude`. If using `opencode`
or another CLI, verify the flags are compatible and update `auto.cli_flags` accordingly.
Set to empty string `""` to pass no extra flags.

## WHAT IT DOES

1. Cleans old reports (older than max_report_days)
2. Scans changes/active/ for proposals with status: proposed
3. Resumes any in-progress change first
4. Launches a fresh CLI session per change (claude or opencode)
5. Each change follows /sudd-run workflow: plan -> apply -> test -> gate -> done
6. After each change: increments discovery.changes_since_last counter
7. After each change: checks time/count budgets
8. **After green:vision completes**: re-scans queue (discovery may have created new proposals)
9. **On empty queue**: runs discovery pipeline if auto_on_empty_queue is enabled (v3.4)
   - Launches CLI subprocess with "/sudd-discover"
   - Re-scans queue after discovery completes
   - If new proposals found: continues processing
   - If still empty: truly done
10. Writes morning report to sudd/auto-reports/{date}/summary.md
11. Crash-recoverable: restart `sudd auto` to resume from where it stopped

## DISCOVERY INTEGRATION (v3.4)

The auto loop triggers discovery in two scenarios:

### Scenario 1: After green:vision
When the green:vision entry completes, /sudd-run's Step 2 may have invoked
/sudd-discover internally. The auto binary re-scans the queue to pick up
any proposals created during that subprocess.

### Scenario 2: Empty queue
When the queue is empty (all proposals processed), the binary checks:
- Is `discovery.auto_on_empty_queue` true in sudd.yaml?
- Does the staleness check pass? (changes_since_last >= run_every_n_changes
  OR last_git_sha differs from current HEAD)

If both: launches a discovery subprocess, then re-scans once. If still
empty after discovery, the session ends normally.

### Changes Counter
Every time a change is archived (DONE or STUCK), the binary increments
`state.json → discovery.changes_since_last`. This feeds the staleness
check so discovery runs periodically based on work completed.
